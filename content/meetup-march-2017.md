Summary: Highlights from the March, 2017 meetup.

Maybe as a sign of maturity as a group the Nairobi Linux Users Group has changed
to holding meet-ups that are more formal with a set agenda instead of just
meeting up and talking about anything in small groups.
It was held at Ona offices and I had the honour of presenting and was the first
meetup to have someone talk. I had the honour of giving the first talk at a LUG
meet-up and in a clear conflict of interest I am the same person writing the
post about how it was :).

The talk I gave was about  nairobi-bot but not just for the bots sake but rather
I was showing some of the advantages of using a pure functional language such
as Haskell I remember touching especially on using [Lazy Bytestrings].

After the talk people talked and had snacks and it ended at around 7 pm.
It was fun and I think everyone enjoyed it. Ona also offered to host other LUG
meetups going forward.

[Here are the nairobi-bot slides that I used in the talk].
